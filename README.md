A few tools to make Parrot OS more enjoyable

I found that I was missing a few tools and added this repo as a way for everyone to enjoy and let me know what extra tools Parrot OS could add. 

Tools I have included is SearchSploit for some reason metasploit is there without one of the most common search functions, EvilWinRM which is great for downloading and uploading files on victim PC`s for Ethical Hacking Purposes.  FFuf which is one of my favourite directory busting tool and HTTPX for checking alive domains.
